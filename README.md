## 4. Interactive Quiz /Interactive Quiz Python

The application is an interactive programming quiz where users answer 10 randomly selected questions from a total pool of X questions stored within the application. Users receive immediate feedback on whether their answers are correct or incorrect. After completing the quiz, users can view their overall score and choose to start a new quiz or exit the application.

## 5. Network Scanner /Network Scanner Python

The Network Scanner is a Python-based tool designed to scan local networks, monitor suspicious activities, and provide real-time alerts. It includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, enabling users to easily interact with the application and view results.

Features

1. Network Scanning

- Allows users to scan a specified network range (e.g., 192.168.0.0/24).
- Utilizes the nmap library to identify active devices, their IP and MAC addresses, status, and open ports.
- Displays scanned devices in a table format.

2. Real-Time Alert Monitoring

- Continuously monitors network activity for suspicious behavior.
- Automatically generates alerts with details such as timestamps, descriptions, severity levels, and recommended actions.
- Alerts are displayed in a dedicated section for quick user access.

3. Detailed Alert Insights

- Users can view detailed information about specific alerts, including:

- Affected IP and MAC addresses.
- Open ports associated with the alert.
- Recommended actions to mitigate potential threats.

4. Dependencies

- `nmap` for network scanning.
- `tkinter` for GUI development.
- `threading` for multithreading operations.
- `time` for timestamp generation.
- `json` for handling alert data.

## 6. Icon Files Creator /Icon Files Creator Python

This Python script utilizes the Pillow library (PIL) to create a multi-size icon file (.ico) from an existing image. The script is designed to handle the following operations:

1. Image Loading:

- The script reads an input image file (image.png) using the Image.open() function from the PIL library.

2. Icon Creation:

- It converts the loaded image into an icon file (stocks.ico).
- The output .ico file includes multiple sizes: 256x256, 128x128, 64x64, 32x32, and 16x16. These sizes are specified in the sizes parameter of the save() function.

3. Usage:

- The resulting .ico file can be used for purposes like application icons or website favicons. The inclusion of multiple sizes ensures compatibility across different display resolutions and contexts.
